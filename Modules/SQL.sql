INTEGER
    is a numeric data type that represents some range of mathematical integers (usually from -2147483648 to +2147483647).
    INTEGER type is good for counters, numeric identifiers, and

DECIMAL(precision, scale).
This type has two parameters: precision and scale.
    Scale is the count of digits to the right of the decimal point.
    Precision is the total count of digits in the number.

--The FLOAT data type is an approximate numeric data type used for floating-point numbers.
--The FLOAT data type has an optional parameter n that specifies the precision and storage size (from 1 to 53)

VARCHAR(n)
/*
    This type represents a string of symbols of varying lengths not longer than n
    For example, one can insert the strings apple, plum, and peach into a column with the type VARCHAR(5).
    The strings orange and banana will exceed the length restriction and the system will either truncate them or generate an error if one tries to insert such long values.
*/

BOOLEAN
    type represents boolean logic values: either TRUE or FALSE

CREATE TABLE census (
                        id INTEGER,
                        name VARCHAR(20),
                        birth_place_latitude REAL,
                        year_income DECIMAL(20,2),
                        is_parent BOOLEAN
);

YOU MAY NOTICE THIS:

CREATE TABLE table_name (
                            column_name_1 column_type_1,
    ...,
                            column_name_n column_type_n
);

You can directly specify the type of literal using the CAST(value AS type) function. Instead of the placeholders value and type, you can use your literal and type

SELECT
    CAST(1 AS DECIMAL(20,3));

In the example above, the numeric value 1 is interpreted as DECIMAL (20,3) and 1.000 as result of query.

SELECT literal;
SELECT 'Hello, World!';

To create a table, use the CREATE TABLE statement
To delete a database, you can use the DROP DATABASE statement
If you want to delete only a specific table, use the DROP TABLE statement

NULL is used in SQL to indicate that some data value is unknown or undefined
2+2âˆ—NULL equals NULL
A NULL value can be stored in a column of any type
NOT NULL constraint in create table statement to specify that a column should not store NULL values
    NULL value basically means "value is not present".
    Nothing equals NULL; not even NULL equals NULL!

CREATE TABLE winners (
                         year INTEGER NOT NULL,
                         field VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
                         winner_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
                         winner_birth_year INTEGER);

SQL supports special predicates for that: IS NULL and IS NOT NULL

True:
SELECT 0+NULL IS NULL;
SELECT '' IS NOT NULL;

False:
SELECT NULL IS NOT NULL;
SELECT 1-1 IS NULL;

You can insert a new record into a table with a simple query using INSERT INTO statement
what you should do is write a list of values to be inserted after the keyword VALUES.

INSERT INTO customers (name, surname, zip_code, city)
VALUES ('Bobby', 'Ray', 60601, 'Chicago');

OR

INSERT INTO customers
VALUES ('Bobby', 'Ray', 60601, 'Chicago');

what if we want to insert more than 1 row?

INSERT INTO customers (name, surname, zip_code, city)
VALUES ('Mary', 'West', 75201, 'Dallas'),
       ('Steve', 'Palmer', 33107, 'Miami');


INSERT INTO table_name (column_1, column_2,..., column_n)
VALUES (list_of_values_1) [, (list_of_values_2), ..., (list_of_values_m)];

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value_1, value_2,..., value_n);

ALTER TABLE
can be used to create, delete or change the type of columns.
You can add a new column to your table with a simple query using the ALTER TABLE statement with ADD COLUMN
To change the data type, make a query with ALTER TABLE statement and MODIFY COLUMN
To drop this column from the table, use the following query with the ALTER TABLE statement and DROP COLUMN
ALTER TABLE statement and CHANGE is used to change the name of a column

The following query will add the column employee_email to our table employees:
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD COLUMN employee_email VARCHAR(10);

As a result of the query execution, column employee_email will have the VARCHAR(45) type
ALTER TABLE employees
MODIFY COLUMN employee_email VARCHAR(45);

As a result deleting the entire native_city column
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP COLUMN native_city;

as a result changing the name of the column
ALTER TABLE employees
CHANGE employee_email email VARCHAR(45);

SUMMARY OF THE ALTER TABLE

To add a new column to the existing table, use this simple query template:
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;

The following query template can delete a column from the table:
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;

To change the column type, you can use this template:
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name NEWDATATYPE;

To change the column name (and, possibly, datatype), use the following template:
ALTER TABLE table_name
CHANGE old_column_name new_column_name NEWDATATYPE;

FOREIN KEYS AND PRIMARY KEYS

To mark a field or a group of fields as a foreign key, we can use the FOREIGN KEY constraint and create the table employees.
keyword REFERENCES specifies the table and the primary key column or columns (in parentheses) with unique values that the foreign key points to
The structure and data type of the primary key and the foreign key must be the same

After the query execution, the table employees becomes a child table, that is, a table containing the foreign key
Now if we try to insert a tuple (1, 'Ann Riding', 4) in the table employees, we will get an error
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (department_id)
    REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);

We can specify how SQL should act if we change the data using ON DELETE and ON UPDATE actions.
We can specify different actions:
    CASCADE: if a row in the parent table is deleted or updated, all matching rows will be deleted or updated automatically;
    SET NULL: if a row in the parent table is deleted or updated, all matching foreign key values in the child table will be set to NULL;
    RESTRICT: if we try to update or delete a row in the parent table, the operation will be rejected;
    SET DEFAULT: if a row with the corresponding value is deleted or updated, the foreign key value in the child table will be set to the default value;
    NO ACTION: this keyword can mean different actions depending on a dialect. In MySQL, it is equivalent to the RESTRICT keyword, so if we create the table employees with one of the queries below, delete and update actions in the table departments will be forbidden.

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id int PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (department_id)
    REFERENCES departments(department_id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

To add a foreign key to the existing table, you can use the ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY statement
If we created our table employees without a foreign key, we can add it with a simple SQL query:

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id);

To add a named foreign key or a FOREIGN KEY constraint to multiple columns, use the ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT statement:

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (department_id)
REFERENCES departments(department_id);

To delete a foreign key, use the ALTER TABLE DROP FOREIGN KEY statement:

ALTER TABLE employees
DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_department;

This will show us the FK
SHOW CREATE TABLE customers;

The PRIMARY KEY constraint specifies a set of columns with values that can help identify any table record.
Since the primary key has to identify each table row, it must be unique and can not be null.
important thing is that a table can have one and only one primary key, but it is allowed to include multiple columns in it

CREATE TABLE chefs (
    chef_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(20),
    last_name VARCHAR(20)
);

We assume that it's possible to have two employees with identical identifiers across different departments,
but it is impossible to have several employees with identical id's in a single department
So, we can have tuples (42, 15, 'Ann Brown') and (43, 15, 'Bob Freud') in the table
but we cannot add a tuple (42, 15, 'John Smith') to that table since there already is an Ann Brown.

In this case, we can define a named PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns when we create the employee table

CREATE TABLE employees (
    department_id INT NOT NULL,
    employee_id INT NOT NULL,
    name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT pk_employee PRIMARY KEY (department_id,employee_id)
);

Assume that we have a table named countries that was created as follows:
CREATE TABLE countries (
    country_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    population INT CHECK (population > 0),
    area REAL NOT NULL
);

We want to make the column country_name our primary key
To add an unnamed PRIMARY KEY constraint to the column country_name, we use the ALTER TABLE ADD PRIMARY KEY statement

ALTER TABLE countries
ADD PRIMARY KEY (country_name);

We can also add a named PRIMARY KEY constraint to an existing table using the ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT
The query below will add a primary key pk_student. This primary key will have two columns: name and birth_date

ALTER TABLE students
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_student PRIMARY KEY (name,birth_date);

To drop the PRIMARY KEY, use ALTER TABLE DROP PRIMARY KEY:

ALTER TABLE students
DROP PRIMARY KEY;

USING ON THE CONSTRAINTS

The NOT NULL constraint will not allow adding a null value to a column. In our table employees, we can make the age column a not null one.

ALTER TABLE employees
MODIFY age INT NOT NULL;

To remove this constraint, just use ALTER TABLE MODIFY again without the NOT NULL attribute:

ALTER TABLE employees
MODIFY age INT;

You can also use this constraint in the CREATE TABLE statement. Just add it to the end of the column type declaration:

CREATE TABLE employees (
    personal_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(30),
    last_name VARCHAR(30),
    age INT NOT NULL
);

The UNIQUE constraint will prohibit adding duplicate values to the column.

CREATE TABLE employees (
    personal_id INT UNIQUE,
    first_name VARCHAR(30),
    last_name VARCHAR(30),
    age INT
);

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD UNIQUE (personal_id);

Sometimes we have to make more than one column unique. In this case, we can define a named constraint at the end of the CREATE TABLE statement:

CREATE TABLE employees (
    personal_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(30),
    last_name VARCHAR(30),
    age INT,
    CONSTRAINT uq_id_last_name UNIQUE (personal_id, last_name)
);

To drop a named constraint, you can also use ALTER TABLE DROP INDEX statement:

ALTER TABLE employees
DROP INDEX uq_id_last_name;

The CHECK constraint allows us to add a logical expression
we can say that all our employees should be older than sixteen. We can add the CHECK constraint in CREATE TABLE

CREATE TABLE employees (
    personal_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(30),
    last_name VARCHAR(30),
    age INT CHECK (age > 16)
);

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CHECK age;

ALTER TABLE employees
DROP CHECK age;

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_employee CHECK (age > 16 AND personal_id > 0);

Both the CHECK constraint and a named UNIQUE constraint may be added using the ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT command.
To delete a named CHECK constraint, you can use the ALTER TABLE DROP CHECK statement.

The DEFAULT constraint defines the initial value in a column: the value that will appear if you dont insert anything
Now even if you add a new row with only personal_id, the columns first_name, last_name, and age will be defined as 'John', 'Doe', and 17 respectively.

CREATE TABLE employees (
    personal_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(30) DEFAULT 'John',
    last_name VARCHAR(30) DEFAULT 'Doe',
    age INT DEFAULT 17
);

To add the DEFAULT constraint to an existing table, use the ALTER TABLE ALTER SET DEFAULT statement:

ALTER TABLE employees
ALTER first_name SET DEFAULT 'John';

To delete an existing DEFAULT constraint, use the ALTER TABLE ALTER DROP DEFAULT statement:

ALTER TABLE employees
ALTER first_name DROP DEFAULT;


Obviously, a column can have more than one constraint.
For example, it is useful to combine NOT NULL and DEFAULT constraints to avoid errors when adding some new information.

CREATE TABLE employees (
    personal_id INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    first_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'John',
    last_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Doe',
    age INT DEFAULT 17,
    CHECK (age > 16)
);
