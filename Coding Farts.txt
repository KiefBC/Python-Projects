Here is a tip for anyone reading this. This will make your life so much easier in the future with error handling.

except Exception as e:
    print(f"The following error occurred : {e}")

Enjoy. This will accept any Exception into {e} and will print out the exact exception into the string.
Even though we didn't specify which one. Amazing. Simply amazing.

    # Capture the input (e.g. 2) as an integer value
index = int(input())

# Get a list of all the exceptions returned from calling the builtin function
all_exceptions = dir(locals()['__builtins__'])

# Print the exception with the index provided as input
print(all_exceptions[index])

Just learned that we can use isalpha() to check if strings contain all letters. interdasting.
