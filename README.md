# What Is This?

Bunch of projects I have done while pursuing the skills of Python. Older projects (my first ones) will be re-done eventually with the skills I attain from continuing my progress. I have TODO's written on each about what I would like to change. It has been a while.

They will come from various sources. Hyperskill and Treehouse to name two. I just want to build. I have learned quite a bit and all projects in this Repo have all been done without cheating. I learn best by writing out examples in my own words and describing them to myself.

I currently practice on LeetCode, CodeWars, Hyperskill, Team Treehouse and a few others. I have a solid grasp on Python now. I keep a record of all the things I learn and use my own examples to further drive home what I'm learning. I really like the mobile app Mimo. You should check it out.

# Folder Projects

Each folder is its own project. I know its not ideal, but for now? It will suffice. I plan on branching this out into each its own folder. Still learning lots.
