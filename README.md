Just some coding projects I done did.

Catch me on Hyperskill. I like to comment, leave hints (If I understand what I'm doing) and Links to help everyone else out.

# Track Questions

Simply just the written code exercises in the Python Beginners Track. My plan is to eventually go through all of it and refactor all my programs I have made and improve them one way or another. I have already made 2 iterations on my Last Pencil. Took me forever.

# Folder Projects

I will keep projects to their own folders. Cleanliness is next to Godliness or whatever.
